Reduced redundant status updates\n- Previously, the `useEffect` was syncing ALL connection status changes to the store\n- But the `handleConnect` and `handleDisconnect` callbacks were ALSO setting status\n- This caused duplicate store updates for 'connected' and 'disconnected' states\n- Changed the `useEffect` to only sync the 'connecting' status, since callbacks handle the other states\n\n### 2. Added missing 'paused' status\n- The validation array for ralph status was missing 'paused'\n- Added it to match the `RalphStatus` type definition in the store\n\n### Investigation Notes\nThe 'once a second' flickering is most likely caused by the websocket reconnect loop when the server isn't running or is unstable (reconnect delay is 1000ms). This is expected behavior - when the backend server is not running, the websocket will cycle between 'connecting' and 'disconnected' states every second. The changes above reduce unnecessary re-renders but won't prevent the status indicator from updating when actual connection state changes occur.","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:43:17Z"}]}
